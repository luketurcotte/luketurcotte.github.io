When I think back to my Masters thesis, the most painful task was copying, rounding, and arranging statistics in tables. Doing it once per table was bad enough, but analytic changes upstream in my workflow meant that this task needed to be repeated many times over. For my dissertation, I vowed to create an analytic pipeline that would accept output directly from SAS.
